RaccoonDB is the Quick and Dirty Prototyping Database for PHP

*It doesn't scale
*It probably can't handle much load
*It's only as secure as you want to make it.
*There are probably bugs and inconsistencies
*It's great if you want to build a json-based rest api in a few minutes without needing to install and run a database service.

Requires PHP 5.3+

It's not really it's own database. RaccoonDB builds a nosql-like interface on top of sqlite built into php. This allows for a quick way to get up and running with a json document store (think couchDB and mongoDB) without needing a dedicated server running the databasing software.

Recommendations on standardizing some sort of security around the db files that get created would be great.

Don't even look at the filter function. ugh.
